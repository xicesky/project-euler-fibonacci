Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

# answer

sequence $ putStrLn . show <$> [(3*i, sum [fib n | n <- [0,3..3*i]]) | i <- [0..12]]

See http://oeis.org/A099919

I couldn't find the proof, that this sum = ( fib (3*n+2) - 1 ) `div` 2
